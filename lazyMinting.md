# Lazy Minting for Large-Scale NFT Distribution

I [minted](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x95a0171984b04b114bf5ec25ddd3610a6972cfb8192dfd5f8ea845b31aafbb18) some [Ants](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x943c40e273c60dbcf20774e166746530fa29d9882ecb37459dbfa462454f733e) for your army, but this is not the most efficient way to build one.

For minting a massive number of NFTs (e.g., billions) to a specific or random address, direct minting during deployment is impractical due to high gas costs and network constraints. Instead, lazy minting provides a scalable and cost-efficient solution.

## Proposed Solution

### 1. At Deployment
- Store a **Merkle Root** on-chain representing the allocation of token IDs to the predefined address.  
- This allows the predefined address to later claim its NFTs on-demand.

### 2. Claim Process
- The predefined address provides a **Merkle Proof** to the contract to mint batches of tokens when needed.  
- This method defers the minting cost to the claim time, spreading gas costs and improving efficiency.

### Benefits
- **Gas Efficiency**: Avoids upfront gas costs for minting billions of NFTs.
- **Scalability**: Easily handles large-scale token distributions.
- **Flexibility**: Tokens are minted only when needed, reducing wasted gas and storage.

### Implementation Notes
This solution demonstrates how we can scale the NFT minting process while ensuring all allocations remain secure and claimable by the rightful address. 

If required, this approach can be implemented to handle billions of Ant NFTs seamlessly.
